    <h1>OMG AN ANIME LOVER! WHAT A NERD</h1>
    <p>But I assure you, anyone can get into this anime. there's things here for everyone! Love, action, comedy, history, and super powers!</p>

    <h3>But that's not all!</h3>
    <p>not only is the story fantastic but the art is extortionary. And my favorite part of the series? Almost every character, stand (screaming punching ghosts(it makes since i promise),and ability is a music, fashion, or food reference.)</p>
    <p>Each character is tailored made to have a bunch of references about the songs, bands, lyrics, and the members themselves. Its amazing that the creator put so much in a character that might only make one appearance.</p>

    <h2>For example!</h2>
    <p>This villain is both a David Bowie and a Queen reference. And he's always "Under Pressure" XD.</p>
    <img src="Kira.png">
    <p>(his ability is called Killer Queen. <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Yoshikage_Kira">Heres the sauce)</a></p>
    <h3>Reasons why I truly believe JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a modern mythology</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Despite what other fans will say I believe you can start any any point in the series and it'll still be good</li>
        <l1>Part 1-6 tells the story of a vampire named Dio who's only goal was to rule the world.</l1>
        <li>While part 7-8 adds to the lore that part 1-6 made and adds more twists into it that you'll never expect.</li>
    </ul>
